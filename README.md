# Neural-Network_Genetic-algorithm_Q-Learning_Unity
It is a university project for a class of Artificial Intellignce. The task given was to compare two machine learning algorithms of choice. The project is a 2D car game, where car's known as agents are steered by a NN(neural network). The project uses a simple genetic algorithm to teach agents how to drive around a track. The other option is to train agents with Q-Learning, to achieve that, a Unity library was used, ML-Agents. User can also drive the car himself. 

IMPORTANT: the code won't run Q-Learning after cloning the repo. It's missing several files from venv\Lib\site-packages\torch\lib\ that were exceeding 100Mb of size and I haven't found a way to upload them yet. Contact me directly if you want the files.
