# Neural-Network_Genetic-algorithm_Q-Learning_Unity
It is a university project for a class of Artificial Intellignce. The task given was to two machine learning algorithms of choice. The project is a 2D car game, where car's known as agents are steered by a NN(neural network). The project uses a simple genetic algorithm to teach agents how to drive around a track. The other option is to train agents with Q-Learning, to achieve that, a Unity library was used, ML-Agents. User can also drive the car himself.
